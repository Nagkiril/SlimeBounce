# SlimeBounce

This repository will contain major complete versions of my personal Android game. Each individual push is made in a private repository elsewhere, thus updates here are expected to be scarce.

Check a dev branch for the project itself and changelog past previous release.

# Gameplay Overview

Idea of a game is that a slime\ball is falling down a road, and Player must eliminate it by one of the methods:
- Dragging to the side of the screen, over a dropout zone that have individual cooldowns after use.
- Exploiting properties of other slimes (every slime type have a unique twist in their behaviour).
- Utilizing Ability buttons on the top left of the screen.

A slime that reaches the end of the road deducts 1 life point. Reaching 0 life points will lose the level, and eliminating all slimes on the level is a victory.

After completing each level, Player receives Experience and Gold (soft currency):
- Experience contributes to Player Level, upon levelling up, Player unlocks additional Slime Types, starts receiving more Gold, but slimes may spawn and move faster.
- Gold is used to purchase Passive upgrades and Abilities in the Shop.

Progression is, of course, saved.

# State of the Project

Right now I'm working on implementing Abilities.

I also improved a lot since the start of this project, so reviewing project is also in order, but I'll be doing it after the last major release.
